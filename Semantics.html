    <h1>HTML Semantic Elements</h1>
    <p>Semantic elements = elements with a meaning.</p>

    <!--What are Semantic Elements?
A semantic element clearly describes its meaning to both the browser and the developer.
Examples of non-semantic elements: <div> and <span> - Tells nothing about its content.
Examples of semantic elements: <img>, <table>, and <article> - Clearly defines its content.-->

    <h2>Semantic Elements in HTML</h2>

    <!--Many web sites contain HTML code like: <div id="nav"> <div class="header"> <div id="footer"> to indicate navigation, header, and footer.
In HTML there are several semantic elements that can be used to define different parts of a web page:  -->

    <!--(<Articles>, <aside>, <details>,<figcaption>,<figure>,<footer>,<header>,<main>,<mark>,<nav>,<section>,<summary>,<time>)

          HTML <section> Element: The <section> element defines a section in a document.According to W3C's HTML documentation: "A section is a thematic grouping of content, typically with a heading."
        
        Examples of where a <section> element can be used:

        Chapters
        Introduction
        News items
        Contact information
        A web page could normally be split into sections for introduction, content, and contact information.
        
        Example
            Two sections in a document:-->  
            
            <section>
                <h1>WWF</h1>
                <p>The World Wide Fund for Nature (WWF) is an international organization working on issues regarding the conservation, research and restoration of the environment, formerly named the World Wildlife Fund. WWF was founded in 1961.</p>
            </section>
            <section>
                <h1>WWF's Panda symbol</h1>
                <p>The Panda has become the symbol of WWF. The well-known panda logo of WWF originated from a panda named Chi Chi that was transferred from the Beijing Zoo to the London Zoo in the same year of the establishment of WWF.</p>
            </section>

            <!-- <h1>HTML <article> Element</h1>
        The <article> element specifies independent, self-contained content.
        An article should make sense on its own, and it should be possible to distribute it independently from the rest of the web site.
        
        Examples of where the <article> element can be used:

        Forum posts
        Blog posts
        User comments
        Product cards
        Newspaper articles

        Example
Three articles with independent, self-contained content:-->

            <h1>The article element</h1>

    <article>
        <h2>Google Chrome</h2>
        <p>Google Chrome is a web browser developed by Google, released in 2008. Chrome is the world's most popular web browser today!</p>
    </article>

    <article>
        <h2>Mozilla Firefox</h2>
        <p>Mozilla Firefox is an open-source web browser developed by Mozilla. Firefox has been the second most popular web browser since January, 2018.</p>
    </article>

    <article>
        <h2>Microsoft Edge</h2>
        <p>Microsoft Edge is a web browser developed by Microsoft, released in 2015. Microsoft Edge replaced Internet Explorer.</p>
    </article>

    <!--Example 2
Use CSS to style the <article> element:-->

    <article class="all-browsers">
  <h1>Most Popular Browsers</h1>

  <article class="browser">
    <h2>Google Chrome</h2>
    <p>Google Chrome is a web browser developed by Google, released in 2008. Chrome is the world's most popular web browser today!</p>
  </article>

  <article class="browser">
    <h2>Mozilla Firefox</h2>
    <p>Mozilla Firefox is an open-source web browser developed by Mozilla. Firefox has been the second most popular web browser since January, 2018.</p>
  </article>

  <article class="browser">

  </article>
</article>

    <!--Nesting <article> in <section> or Vice Versa?
        The <article> element specifies independent, self-contained content.
        The <section> element defines section in a document.
        So, you will find HTML pages with <section> elements containing <article> elements, and <article> elements containing <section> elements.-->
                
        <!--HTML <header> Element
            The <header> element represents a container for introductory content or a set of navigational links.
            A <header> element typically contains:

            one or more heading elements (<h1> - <h6>)
            logo or icon
            authorship information-->

            <!--Note: You can have several <header> elements in one HTML document. However, <header> cannot be placed within a <footer>, <address> or another <header> element.-->

    <!--Example
A header for an <article>: -->

    <article>
        <header>
            <h1>What does WWF Do?</h1>
            <p>WWF's mission:</p>
        </header> <!--Close the header-->

        <p>WWF's mission is to stop the degradation of our planet's natural environment, and build a future in which humans live in harmony with nature.</p>

    </article>

        <!--HTML <footer> Element
    The <footer> element defines a footer for a document or section.
        A <footer> element typically contains:

            authorship information
            copyright information
            contact information
            sitemap
            back to top links
            related documents
            You can have several <footer> elements in one document.
                
            Example
        A footer section in a document:-->

            <footer>
                <p>Author: Joramz</p>
                <p><a href="mailto:joramzyor23@gmail.com">joramzyor23@gmail.com</a></p>
            </footer>

            <!--<h1>HTML <nav> Element</h1>
            The <nav> element defines a set of navigation links.
    Notice that NOT all links of a document should be inside a <nav> element. The <nav> element is intended only for major blocks of navigation links.

    Browsers, such as screen readers for disabled users, can use this element to determine whether to omit the initial rendering of this content.-->

        <nav>
            <a href="/html/">HTML</a> |
            <a href="/css/">CSS</a> |
            <a href="/js/">JavaScript</a> |
            <a href="/jquery/">jQuery</a> 
        </nav>

        <!--HTML <aside> Element

        The <aside> element defines some content aside from the content it is placed in (like a sidebar).
        The <aside> content should be indirectly related to the surrounding content.
            Example
    Display some content aside from the content it is placed in:-->

    <p>My family and I visited The Epcot center this summer. The weather was nice, and Epcot was amazing! I had a great summer together with my family!</p>

    <aside>
         <h4>Epcot Center</h4>
        <p>Epcot is a theme park at Walt Disney World Resort featuring exciting attractions, international pavilions, award-winning fireworks and seasonal special events.</p>
    </aside>

    <!--Example 2
    Use CSS to style the <aside> element:-->
        <aside>
            <p>The Epcot center is a theme park at Walt Disney World Resort featuring exciting attractions, international pavilions, award-winning fireworks and seasonal special events.</p>
        </aside>

        <!--HTML <figure> and <figcaption> Elements
        The <figure> tag specifies self-contained content, like illustrations, diagrams, photos, code listings, etc.

    The <figcaption> tag defines a caption for a <figure> element. The <figcaption> element can be placed as the first or as the last child of a <figure> element.

    The <img> element defines the actual image/illustration. -->

        <h2>Places to Visit</h2>

        <p>Puglia's most famous sight is the unique conical houses (Trulli) found in the area around Alberobello, a declared UNESCO World Heritage Site.</p>
