    <h1>HTML Block & Inline</h1>
    <p>Every HTML element has a default display value, depending on what type of element it is.
    The two most common display values are block and inline.</p>
    
    <h2>Block-level Elements</h2>
    <p>A block-level element always starts on a new line, and the browsers automatically add some space (a margin) before and after the element.<br>
    A block-level element always takes up the full width available (stretches out to the left and right as far as it can).<br>
    Two commonly used block elements are:tag 'p' and tag 'div'.<br>
    <!--The <p> element defines a paragraph in an HTML document.-->
    <!--The <div> element defines a division or a section in an HTML document.--> </p>

    <!--Example:
    <p>Hellow world</p>
    <div>Hello world</div>  
    Here are the block-level elements in HTML:

    <address><article><aside><blockquote><canvas><dd><div><dl>
    <dt><fieldset><figcaption><figure><footer><form><h1>-<h6><header><hr>
    <li><main><nav><noscript><ol><p><pre><section><table><tfoot><ul><video>  -->

    <h3>Inline Elements</h3>
    <!--An inline element does not start on a new line.
    An inline element only takes up as much width as necessary.
    This is a <span> element inside a paragraph.
    Example: <span>Hellow world</span>
    
    Here are the inline elements in HTML:

    <a><abbr><acronym><b><bdo><big><br><button><cite><code><dfn>
    <em><i><img><input><kbd><label><map><object><output><q><samp>
    <script><select><small><span><strong><sub><sup><textarea><time><tt><var>-->

        <h4>The div Eelement </h4>
        <!--The <div> element is often used as a container for other HTML elements.
The <div> element has no required attributes, but style, class and id are common.
When used together with CSS, the <div> element can be used to style blocks of content:
    Examplpe:-->

    <div style="background-color: black; color: white; padding: 20px;">
        <h2>London</h2>
        <p>London is the capital city of England. It is the most populous city
        in the united Kingdom, with a metropoltan area of over 13 million inhabitants. </p>
        <p>Standinig on the Risver Thames, London has been a major settlement for two millenia. 
        It's history going back to its founding by the Romans, who named it Londinum. </p>
    </div>

    <h1>The Span Element</h1>
    <!--The <span> element is an inline container used to mark up a part of a text, or a part of a document.
    The <span> element has no required attributes, but style, class and id are common.
    When used together with CSS, the <span> element can be used to style parts of the text:
        Example:-->

        <p>My mother has <span style="color: blue; font-weight: bold;"> blue </span> eyes and my father 
        has <span style="color: darkolivegreen; font-weight: bold;"> dark green</span> eyes.</p>
